        I am a graduate from the Univeristy of Georgia with a Bachelor's Degree
        in Entertainment Studies. Originally I wanted to be an editior for
        television and movies but found myself wanting to delve even further
        into the technical side of things. I began programming in October of
        2020 to stay busy during the pandemic but found that I really enjoyed it
        and wanted to do it as a career. Though my first language was Java I am
        spending a majority of my current time working with React. I am
        currently looking for my first programming job and do not have a
        preference towards front-end or back end, I just enjoy coding.
